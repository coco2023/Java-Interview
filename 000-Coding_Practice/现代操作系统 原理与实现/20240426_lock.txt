1. 两个线程交替打印两个数组，类似于 [1, 2, 3, 4] 和 [9, 8, 7, 6] 打印成 [1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6]
// 使用 Java 中的 synchronized 关键字来实现线程间的协作
// 两个线程交替使用一个共享对象lock来控制打印顺序，确保交替进行。
// Object lock: This is a shared object used as a monitor.The threads synchronize on this object to ensure that only one thread can execute a block of code that manipulates shared resources (in this case, the console output) at a time.
// notify() wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor. If any threads are waiting on this object, one of them is chosen to be awakened.
// Without synchronization (using wait and notify inside synchronized blocks), both threads could attempt to print at the same time, leading to jumbled output.
// The use of wait() and notify() minimizes CPU usage compared to a busy-wait approach. Threads that cannot do useful work (because they must wait for their turn) relinquish the CPU to other threads.
// Monitor Lock: In Java, each object has an intrinsic lock or monitor lock. When a synchronized method or block is entered, the lock is acquired, and when the thread exits the synchronized method or block, the lock is released

// Thread t1 starts and acquires the lock on lock, prints an element from array1, calls notify(), and then goes into a wait state by calling wait(). This releases the lock, allowing t2 to acquire it.
// Once t1 calls notify(), t2 attempts to acquire the lock

// CPU and JVM Interaction during wait/notify:
// wait(): When a thread calls wait() on the object, it releases the lock on that object and enters the waiting state. This state change is managed by the JVM, which communicates with the OS to suspend the thread's execution, allowing the CPU to allocate resources to other runnable threads. This helps in efficient CPU utilization.
// notify(): This method wakes up one of the threads (if any) that are waiting on the object's monitor. The thread that wakes up will compete for the lock on the object; once it acquires the lock, it resumes execution.

// CPU Utilization and Context Switching
// The CPU manages the execution of these threads, which includes context switching between t1 and t2.
//        Each context switch involves storing the state of the current thread and loading the state of the next thread to run.
// Using wait() and notify() helps in reducing CPU usage as it avoids busy waiting, where a thread would otherwise continuously check a condition.
// Instead, threads that cannot proceed surrender the CPU willingly until they are explicitly notified to continue

// JVM's Role
// The JVM schedules the threads and manages their states (running, waiting, runnable, etc.). It interacts with the underlying operating system to handle lower-level details of thread scheduling and state management.
// The JVM ensures that memory visibility and access synchronization are handled correctly when multiple threads interact through shared objects. The synchronized block ensures that memory writes by one thread are visible to another, which is crucial for correct synchronization

在 Java 程序中，特别是使用多线程时，确实涉及到了上下文切换（context switching）。上下文切换是操作系统在多任务和多线程环境中管理进程或线程的一种机制。在多线程程序如 `AlternatePrinter` 中，当不同的线程（如 `t1` 和 `t2`）交替执行时，操作系统需要在它们之间进行切换。

### 如何实现上下文切换？

在你提到的 Java 程序中，`t1` 和 `t2` 通过 `synchronized` 关键字和 `wait()` 及 `notify()` 方法进行同步。当一个线程如 `t1` 调用 `wait()` 方法时，它会释放当前持有的锁（在这个场景中是 `lock` 对象）并进入等待状态。这时，操作系统将 `t1` 线程置于等待队列中，并进行上下文切换，把 CPU 控制权转移给另一个线程，即 `t2`。当 `t2` 在其执行过程中到达相应的 `notify()` 调用时，它会通知操作系统 `t1` 可以继续执行。此时如果 `t2` 也调用了 `wait()`，则同样释放锁并等待，操作系统需要再次进行上下文切换，恢复 `t1` 的执行状态。

### 上下文切换的实现细节：

1. **保存和恢复状态**：操作系统在进行上下文切换时，会保存当前线程的状态（如 CPU 寄存器状态、程序计数器等），然后加载另一个线程的状态。这样，每个线程都可以从上次暂停的地方继续执行。

2. **线程调度**：操作系统的调度器决定哪个线程获得 CPU 执行权。在 Java 中，JVM 内部模型将 Java 线程映射到操作系统原生线程上，由操作系统的线程调度器管理。

3. **同步机制**：在 Java 中，`synchronized`，`wait()` 和 `notify()` 为线程提供了一种同步机制，以确保在并发环境下数据的一致性和线程的有序执行。

### 总结

在涉及到多线程交互和资源共享的程序中，上下文切换是不可避免的。它允许操作系统有效地管理多个线程，使得即使在单核 CPU 上也能实现多任务并发执行。虽然上下文切换有助于资源管理和线程间的公平调度，但也会引入一定的性能开销。因此，合理设计线程同步和交互逻辑，以减少不必要的上下文切换，是提高多线程程序效率的关键。

// Sequence Diagram Description
### Sequence Diagram Description

**Participants:**
- `t1`: Thread for printing elements from `array1`.
- `t2`: Thread for printing elements from `array2`.
- `lock`: The synchronization object used to coordinate the interaction between `t1` and `t2`.

**Flow of Events:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Both `t1` and `t2` are initialized. `t1` starts execution immediately since it's started first in the code.

2. **t1 Starts Execution:**
   - **Acquire Lock**: `t1` enters a synchronized block by acquiring the `lock`.
   - **Print**: `t1` prints the first element from `array1`.
   - **Notify**: `t1` calls `lock.notify()` to signal `t2` that it can proceed.
   - **Wait**: `t1` calls `lock.wait()` to release the lock and enter the waiting state.

3. **t2 Starts Execution:**
   - **Wait for Notify**: Initially, `t2` starts and immediately calls `lock.wait()` inside the synchronized block, waiting for `t1` to release the lock and notify.
   - **Acquire Lock After Notify**: Once `t1` executes `lock.notify()`, `t2` is awakened (assuming it's the only other thread waiting), and it acquires the lock.
   - **Print**: `t2` prints the first element from `array2`.
   - **Notify**: `t2` calls `lock.notify()` to wake up `t1`.
   - **Wait**: `t2` calls `lock.wait()` to release the lock and wait, letting `t1` resume.

4. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - Steps 2 and 3 repeat for each element in the arrays, with `t1` and `t2` alternating control of the lock, printing elements from their respective arrays.

5. **Final Element Printed:**
   - When the last element is printed by either `t1` or `t2`, the thread that prints last will not call `lock.wait()` but will end after notifying the other thread.

6. **Completion of Execution:**
   - Both threads complete their execution once all elements are printed.

### Diagram Notation

The sequence diagram would consist of two vertical lifelines (one for `t1` and one for `t2`), with horizontal arrows representing method calls (`notify()`, `wait()`) and block entries (`synchronized(lock)`). Time flows downward, and the interactions are marked at the points where threads acquire the lock, print, notify the other thread, and then wait.

                                                            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                                                  }
                                                  System.out.println(array2[i]);          // Once t2 is awaked by t1, it will print element in array2
                                                  lock.notify();                          // then, t2 will wake up t1
                                        }

2. 在Java中实现多个用户抢红包的程序涉及到线程安全和并发控制的问题
// draw(): A synchronized method that allows a thread to draw a random portion of the remaining amount in the red packet. Synchronization is crucial here to prevent race conditions, where multiple threads could attempt to draw money simultaneously, leading to incorrect calculations of the remaining amount
// draw(): Synchronized to ensure that only one thread can access this method at a time

// Detailed Execution Process and JVM/CPU Interactions
//        Thread Creation: A loop in the main method generates 10 threads. Each thread represents a person attempting to grab money from the red packet. Each thread is started immediately after its creation, leading to concurrent execution.
//        Concurrency and Synchronization: Each thread executes the draw() method on the shared RedPacket instance.
//        Since draw() is synchronized, when a thread enters this method, it acquires an intrinsic lock associated with the RedPacket object. No other thread can enter any synchronized method on the same object until the lock is released
// JVM and Thread Management：
//        JVM Scheduling: The JVM schedules the threads according to the underlying operating system's policies and the JVM's thread scheduling algorithms, which may include considerations like priority, thread states, and fairness.
//        Lock Management: The JVM manages the lock on the RedPacket object, ensuring that threads waiting to enter the synchronized block are queued and managed efficiently.
// CPU Utilization and Context Switching:
//        Context Switching: The operating system performs context switching to allocate CPU time to different threads. Each context switch involves saving the state of a currently executing thread and loading the state of the next thread to run.
//        Efficient CPU Usage: Using synchronized minimizes unnecessary CPU usage by ensuring that threads that cannot proceed (because the resource is locked) are not actively consuming CPU cycles
// Race Conditions and Thread Safety:
//        The synchronized method draw() prevents race conditions where multiple threads might corrupt the shared state (remaining amount of money).
// Execution and Output:
//        The threads print their results concurrently. Depending on when each thread gets CPU time and access to the console (another synchronized resource), the output order might vary.

class RedPacket {
          private double totalAmounts;
          private double remainingAmounts;

          public RedPacket (double totalAmount) {
                    this.totalAmount  = totalAmount;
                    this.remainingAmount = remainingAmount;
          }

          public synchronized double draw () {
                    if (remainingAmount > 0) {
                              double maxDraw = remainingAmount * 0.2;
                              double drawnAmount = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextDouble(0.01, maxDraw);
                              remainingAmount -= drawnAmount;
                              return drawnAmount;
                    } else {
                              return 0.0;
                    }
          }

          public double getRemainingAmount () {
                    return remainingAmounts;
          }
}
class RedPacketGrabber {
          public static void main (String[] args) {
                    final RedPacket redPacket = new RedPacket(100.0);

                    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                              new Thread(() -> {
                                        double amount = redPacket.draw();
                                        if (amount > 0) {
                                                  System.out.prinln(Thread.currentThread().getName() + "get " + amount + "CNY");
                                        } else {
                                                  System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + "none");
                                        }
                              }, "Person " + (i + 1)).start(); 
                    }

3. 10个 100g 日志文件寻找 TOP100 query，一台机器有 10G 内存，可以使用多台机器
对于处理大数据文件并在内存限制的条件下找到最常见的查询，可以采用 MapReduce 框架来处理。以下是一个高级概述，描述了如何在多台机器上使用 Java 实现这个任务：

1. **分割日志文件**：首先，将每个 100GB 的日志文件分割成更小的块，比如说每个块1GB，这样每个块可以单独在一台机器上处理。

2. **Map阶段**：每台机器读取一个或多个1GB的块，对每个查询进行计数并存储在本地。这可以通过哈希表来实现。

3. **Shuffle阶段**：将所有机器上处理的数据按照查询关键字的哈希值进行分组，相同的查询会被发送到同一台机器上进行最终统计。

4. **Reduce阶段**：每台机器收到属于它的查询后，合并同一个查询的计数，然后找出每台机器上计数最高的100个查询。

5. **合并结果**：将所有机器上的top 100查询结果合并，再次进行排序和筛选，得到最终的全局TOP100查询。

这种方法需要考虑网络传输、磁盘IO和内存使用等多种资源，因此在实际部署时需要根据具体环境进行调优。
