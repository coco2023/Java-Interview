# Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol Demo
Sure! Let's delve deeper into the Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol, which is one of the sliding window protocols used for reliable data transfer over networks. We'll explain how the sender and receiver operate in this protocol, and I'll provide a simple practice/demo project that you can implement to understand the workflow better.

### Go-Back-N (GBN) Protocol: Sender and Receiver

#### Sender Operations:
1. **Window Size**: The sender maintains a window of `N` frames that it can send without waiting for an acknowledgment. This window slides as acknowledgments are received.
2. **Sequence Numbers**: Each frame has a sequence number, and the sender can send frames up to `N` frames ahead of the last acknowledged frame.
3. **Timer**: The sender starts a timer for the oldest unacknowledged frame. If the timer expires, all frames in the window are retransmitted.
4. **Acknowledgments (ACKs)**: The sender advances its window when it receives acknowledgments for frames.

#### Receiver Operations:
1. **Window Size**: The receiver can only accept frames in the correct sequence.
2. **Sequence Numbers**: The receiver expects frames in sequential order. If a frame is missing, it discards all subsequent frames until the missing frame is received.
3. **Acknowledgments**: The receiver sends an acknowledgment for the last correctly received frame. This acknowledgment implicitly acknowledges all previous frames.

### Example of Sender and Receiver Workflow

- **Window Size `N`**: 4
- **Frames to Send**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

#### Sender Workflow:
1. Sends frames 1, 2, 3, 4.
2. Waits for acknowledgments.
3. Receives ACK for frame 1, slides the window to send frame 5.
4. Receives ACK for frame 2, slides the window to send frame 6.
5. Timer expires for frame 3 (if no ACK received), retransmits frames 3, 4, 5, 6.

#### Receiver Workflow:
1. Receives frames 1, 2, 3, 4, and sends ACKs for each.
2. If frame 3 is missing and it receives frame 4, it discards frame 4 and keeps sending ACK for frame 2 until frame 3 is received.

### Practice/Demo Project: Implementing a Simple Go-Back-N Protocol

You can create a simple simulation of the Go-Back-N protocol using Python. This project will help you understand the flow of data between the sender and receiver and the sliding window mechanism.

### Java Implementation of Go-Back-N Protocol

#### 1. Define the `Sender` Class

The sender will be responsible for sending frames, handling timeouts, and managing acknowledgments.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class Sender {
    private final int windowSize;
    private final int totalFrames;
    private final int[] frames;
    private final boolean[] acknowledged;
    private int base;
    private int nextSeqNum;
    private final BlockingQueue<Integer> ackQueue;
    private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler;

    public Sender(int windowSize, int totalFrames) {
        this.windowSize = windowSize;
        this.totalFrames = totalFrames;
        this.frames = new int[totalFrames];
        this.acknowledged = new boolean[totalFrames];
        Arrays.fill(acknowledged, false);
        for (int i = 0; i < totalFrames; i++) {
            frames[i] = i + 1;
        }
        this.base = 0;
        this.nextSeqNum = 0;
        this.ackQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(totalFrames);
        this.scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(windowSize);
    }

    public void sendFrame(int frame) {
        System.out.println("Sender: Sending frame " + frame);
        Receiver.receiveFrame(frame);
        scheduler.schedule(() -> timeout(frame), 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    }

    public void timeout(int frame) {
        synchronized (this) {
            if (!acknowledged[frame - 1]) {
                System.out.println("Sender: Timeout for frame " + frame + ". Resending window.");
                resendWindow();
            }
        }
    }

    public void resendWindow() {
        for (int i = 0; i < windowSize; i++) {
            if (base + i < totalFrames) {
                sendFrame(frames[base + i]);
            }
        }
    }

    public void receiveAck() {
        while (true) {
            try {
                Integer ack = ackQueue.take();
                if (ack == -1) {
                    break;
                }
                synchronized (this) {
                    System.out.println("Sender: Received ACK for frame " + ack);
                    acknowledged[ack - 1] = true;
                    if (ack == frames[base]) {
                        while (base < totalFrames && acknowledged[base]) {
                            base++;
                            if (nextSeqNum < totalFrames) {
                                sendFrame(frames[nextSeqNum]);
                                nextSeqNum++;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                System.err.println("Sender: Interrupted while waiting for ACKs.");
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    public void start() {
        new Thread(this::receiveAck).start();
        while (nextSeqNum < windowSize) {
            sendFrame(frames[nextSeqNum]);
            nextSeqNum++;
        }
    }

    public BlockingQueue<Integer> getAckQueue() {
        return ackQueue;
    }

    public void stop() {
        scheduler.shutdownNow();
    }
}
```

#### 2. Define the `Receiver` Class

The receiver will handle incoming frames and send acknowledgments.

```java
public class Receiver {
    private static final int totalFrames = 10;
    private static int expectedFrame = 1;

    public static void receiveFrame(int frame) {
        if (frame == expectedFrame) {
            System.out.println("Receiver: Received expected frame " + frame);
            expectedFrame++;
            SenderDemo.ackQueue.add(frame);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Receiver: Discarding frame " + frame + ". Expected frame " + expectedFrame);
            SenderDemo.ackQueue.add(expectedFrame - 1);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Simulate Network Environment

Simulate frame loss to test the protocol's resilience.

```java
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class NetworkSimulator {
    private final Random random = new Random();
    private final Sender sender;

    public NetworkSimulator(Sender sender) {
        this.sender = sender;
    }

    public void simulateLoss() {
        ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
        scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
            int lostFrame = random.nextInt(sender.getAckQueue().remainingCapacity()) + 1;
            System.out.println("Simulating network: Frame " + lostFrame + " lost!");
            sender.getAckQueue().add(lostFrame - 1);
        }, 1, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    }
}
```

#### 4. Main Class to Run the Simulation

Combine everything in a main class to run the simulation.

```java
public class SenderDemo {
    public static BlockingQueue<Integer> ackQueue;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int windowSize = 4;
        int totalFrames = 10;

        Sender sender = new Sender(windowSize, totalFrames);
        ackQueue = sender.getAckQueue();

        NetworkSimulator simulator = new NetworkSimulator(sender);

        new Thread(sender::start).start();
        new Thread(simulator::simulateLoss).start();

        // Simulate running for a while
        try {
            Thread.sleep(30000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            sender.stop();
            System.out.println("Simulation complete.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sender Class**:
   - Manages a window of frames, sends frames, handles timeouts, and retransmits frames if necessary.
   - Uses a scheduled executor service to simulate timeouts.
   - Uses a blocking queue to receive acknowledgments.

2. **Receiver Class**:
   - Receives frames and sends back acknowledgments.
   - Keeps track of the expected frame and discards out-of-order frames.

3. **NetworkSimulator Class**:
   - Simulates network conditions by randomly "losing" frames to test the resilience of the protocol.

4. **Main Class**:
   - Combines the sender, receiver, and network simulator to run the Go-Back-N protocol simulation.

This Java implementation simulates the Go-Back-N protocol with concurrency and a simulated network environment. It demonstrates how sliding window protocols work and how they handle packet loss, retransmissions, and acknowledgments in a network setting. This exercise is valuable for understanding flow control and error handling in reliable data transfer protocols.

### Python Implementation of Go-Back-N Protocol

#### Project Setup:
1. **Python**: Install Python on your system.
2. **Simulate Network**: You can simulate the network communication using Python's `threading` and `queue` modules to represent sender and receiver.

#### Example Code:

```python
import threading
import queue
import time
import random

class Sender:
    def __init__(self, window_size, total_frames):
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.total_frames = total_frames
        self.frames = list(range(1, total_frames + 1))
        self.acknowledged = [False] * total_frames
        self.base = 0
        self.next_seq_num = 0
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.ack_queue = queue.Queue()

    def send_frame(self, frame):
        print(f"Sender: Sending frame {frame}")
        receiver.receive_frame(frame)
        threading.Timer(2, self.timeout, [frame]).start()

    def timeout(self, frame):
        with self.lock:
            if not self.acknowledged[frame - 1]:
                print(f"Sender: Timeout for frame {frame}. Resending window.")
                self.resend_window()

    def resend_window(self):
        for i in range(self.window_size):
            if self.base + i < self.total_frames:
                self.send_frame(self.frames[self.base + i])

    def receive_ack(self):
        while True:
            ack = self.ack_queue.get()
            if ack == -1:
                break
            with self.lock:
                print(f"Sender: Received ACK for frame {ack}")
                self.acknowledged[ack - 1] = True
                if ack == self.frames[self.base]:
                    while self.base < self.total_frames and self.acknowledged[self.base]:
                        self.base += 1
                        if self.next_seq_num < self.total_frames:
                            self.send_frame(self.frames[self.next_seq_num])
                            self.next_seq_num += 1

    def start(self):
        threading.Thread(target=self.receive_ack).start()
        while self.next_seq_num < self.window_size:
            self.send_frame(self.frames[self.next_seq_num])
            self.next_seq_num += 1

class Receiver:
    def __init__(self, total_frames):
        self.total_frames = total_frames
        self.expected_frame = 1

    def receive_frame(self, frame):
        if frame == self.expected_frame:
            print(f"Receiver: Received expected frame {frame}")
            self.expected_frame += 1
            sender.ack_queue.put(frame)
        else:
            print(f"Receiver: Discarding frame {frame}. Expected frame {self.expected_frame}")
            sender.ack_queue.put(self.expected_frame - 1)

def simulate_loss():
    while True:
        time.sleep(random.randint(1, 5))
        lost_frame = random.randint(1, sender.total_frames)
        if not sender.acknowledged[lost_frame - 1]:
            print(f"Simulating network: Frame {lost_frame} lost!")
            time.sleep(2)  # Simulate delay
            sender.ack_queue.put(lost_frame - 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    window_size = 4
    total_frames = 10

    sender = Sender(window_size, total_frames)
    receiver = Receiver(total_frames)

    sender_thread = threading.Thread(target=sender.start)
    loss_thread = threading.Thread(target=simulate_loss)

    sender_thread.start()
    loss_thread.start()

    sender_thread.join()
    loss_thread.join()

    print("Simulation complete.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sender**: 
   - Maintains a sliding window of frames.
   - Sends frames and starts a timer for each frame.
   - Retransmits frames on timeout.
   - Receives ACKs and slides the window accordingly.

2. **Receiver**: 
   - Receives frames and sends ACKs.
   - Discards out-of-order frames.

3. **Simulated Network**: 
   - Simulates frame loss to test retransmission logic.

### Running the Simulation:
- This code simulates the sending and receiving of frames using the Go-Back-N protocol.
- It uses threading to simulate concurrent operations and a queue to handle acknowledgments.
- It includes a network simulation that randomly drops frames to test the robustness of the protocol.

### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the workflow of the Go-Back-N protocol, including frame transmission, acknowledgment handling, and retransmission upon timeouts. It's an excellent way to understand the mechanics of sliding window protocols in computer networks. Remember, this is a simulation, and real network programming would involve more complexities and considerations.
